# JSONRPCBase

> NOTE: This is a fork of [level12/jsonrpc11base](https://github.com/level12/jsonrpc11base/) with changes maintained by KBase

This  is a simple JSON-RPC 1.1 library without and agnostic to a transport layer.

It features optional `jsonschema` validation of method parameters and results.

This library is intended as an auxiliary library for relatively easy implementation of JSON-RPC services with Unix/TCP socket
like transport protocols that do not have complex special requirements. You need to utilize some suitable transport
protocol with this library to actually provide a working JSON-RPC service.

Please note that "JSON-RPC 1.1" was never finalized as a standard. There were several competing drafts. This implementation is based on the "working draft" of JSON-RPC 1.1. Where incomplete, JSON-RPC 2.0 features are backfilled. This primary affects error codes, which were never finally defined in 1.1.

This library is intended to support older clients using JSON-RPC 1.1 and which need a solid implementation until they can be ported to the more recent and well-defined JSON-RPC 2.0. 

## Features

- Easy to use, small size, well tested.
- Supports JSON-RPC v1.1 (working draft).
- Strict enforcement of JSON-RPC v1.1 spec.
- Optional argument type and return type validation.
- JSON-RPC 2.0 error codes.
    - v1.1 working draft document does not provide error code values, 
      so 2.0 error codes are at least well defined.

## Example

Example usage:

```py
import jsonrpc11, APIError, CustomServerError  from kbase_jsonrpc11base
import HTTPServer, BaseHTTPRequestHandler from http.server

service = jsonrpc11.JSONRPCService()

db = {}
last_id = 0

add(notification):
    last_id = last_id + 1
    db[last_id] = notification
    return last_id

get(id):
    if id not in db:
        raise APIError(100, f'Notification not found with id {id}')
    return db[id]

search(query):
    return [n for n in db if query i n]

 # Adds the method login to the service as a 'new' using the optional "name" parameter
service.add(add, name = 'new')

# Adds the method "get" to the service; the function name will become the service method.
service.add(get)

# Adds the method "search"
search.add(search)

class ServiceHandler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
    def doPOST(self):
        # read body
        body = self.body

        # assume it is a service call.
        response = service.call(body)

        self.wfile.write(response)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    httpd = HTTPServer(('0.0.0.0', 8888), ServiceHandler)
    httpd.server_forever()
```

## Adherence (or lack thereof) to the spec

This is an implementation of [JSON-RPC 1.1 (working draft)](https://jsonrpc.org/historical/json-rpc-1-1-wd.html).

This spec was never published, and was superseded by [JSON-RPC 2.0](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification).

The reason for the existence of this library is to support legacy projects which already use 1.1. One of these projects is [KBase](https://www.kbase.us), which has hundreds of dependencies on JSON-RPC 1.1, and therefore needs this support until these usages one day migrates to 2.0 or something else.

As JSON-RPC 1.1 (working draft) was incomplete, this implementation borrows some from JSON-RPC  2.0.

### Error Codes

Error codes were specified in 1.1 as an integer between 0 and 999, but the error codes were never assigned. So instead we utilize the [error codes from JSON-RPC 2.0](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification#error_object).

### HTTP

Since this library is transport agnostic, all implications of HTTP usage are ignored. Specifically, "7.1. HTTP Status Code Requirements" and  "7.2. HTTP Header Requirements" are ignored. (See the [working draft document](https://jsonrpc.org/historical/json-rpc-1-1-wd.html).) 

## Development

Install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) and run `poetry install`.

Run tests with `make test`.

Deploy with `poetry build` and `poetry publish`.

## TODO

- support banning of "system." as method prefix
- support "system.describe" (see [9. Services](https://jsonrpc.org/historical/json-rpc-1-1-wd.html#Services))
